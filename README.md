# RAP110 - Build transactional SAP Fiori elements-based Apps with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)

## Level: Intermediate
## Introduction

#### Description
This repository contains the material for the hands-on session **RAP110 - Building Fiori Apps with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)**. It includes a managed Business Object (BO) with two BO nodes or entities, and features such as virtual elements in dealing with BO projection views, late numbering, determine actions, static default factory actions, side effects, functions, business event exposure, and additional save.

## üîéOverview

> This workshop is all about RAP fundamentals; especially about how to use RAP core features when building greenfield implementations.

### Business Scenario
> In this hands-on session we will guide you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Travel Processing App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation with semantic key and late numbering. We will give you more details on the scenario in the different exercises.
>   
> The OData service you are going to implement is based on the _ABAP Flight Reference Scenario_. To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing worldwide Travels for multiple Agencies is requesting you to build a new Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing (i.e. creating, updating and deleting) Travels. 
  
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

The resulting _Travel_ app is a SAP Fiori elements-based List Report app with search, filter, and draft capabilities for processing travel bookings. A navigation to an Object Page for displaying the details of each _travel_ entry in the list report is offered. The application will look like this: 

**List Report**:

**Object Page**:

Below is the simplified _Flight_ data model underlying the app.

### About the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
[^Top of page](#)
   
> **ABAP Cloud** is the development model for building cloud-ready business apps, services and extensions on SAP BTP and all SAP S/4HANA editions, i.e. public or private cloud, and even on-premise.
>
> The **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** is the centerpiece of _ABAP Cloud development model_ for building transactional, cloud-ready SAP Fiori apps and Web APIs. RAP offers a set of concepts, tools, languages, and powerful frameworks provided on the ABAP platform. It supports the efficient development of innovative and cloud-ready enterprise applications, as well as the extension of SAP standard applications in an upgrade-stable way in the cloud and on-premise.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

RAP is an enabler for improving the user experience and innovating business processes in ABAP-based SAP solutions by leveraging SAP Fiori, SAP HANA, and the cloud. 
It is a long-term strategic solution for ABAP development on SAP‚Äôs flagship product SAP S/4HANA, in the cloud and on-premise (as of release 1909), as well as on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment.

The illustration below shows the high-level end-to-end development stack when working with RAP.
