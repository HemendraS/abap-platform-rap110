# Exercise 13: Explore the Entity Manipulation Language (EML)

## Introduction

ðŸš¸
So far, the Entity Manipulation Language (EML) was used in the so-called `IN LOCAL MODE` to implement the transactional behavior of the _Travel_ BO entity in the behavior pool. 

In the previous exercise, you've  (see [Exercise 12](../ex12/readme.md)).

In the present exercise, you will explore how to use EML to consume - i.e. read, update, create, and delete - instances of the _Travel_ BO entity from outside the RAP context. An ABAP class containing sample EML-based access implementations for the _Travel_ BO entity is provided for the purpose. 

This exercise is all about exploring and better understanding EML. Follow the instructions below - and feel free to copy and modify the sample implementations as you like.

ðŸš¸

Now that you've played around with various EML statements to 

- deep create
- read function
-
---

- read _Travel_ entity instances,
- update _Travel_ entity instances,
- create new _Travel_ entity instances,
- delete _Travel_ entity instances,
- activate draft _Travel_ entity instances, and 
- discard draft _Travel_ entity instances,

you are done with this hands-on. **Congratulations!**

In this hands-on session, you have learned how to build a simple Fiori elements app with _managed_ implementation type of the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) and how to write a BO test with ABAP Unit, and access BOs outside of the RAP context using the Entity Manipulation Language (EML)!

Thank you for attending this workshop!
